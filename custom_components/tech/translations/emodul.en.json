Normal temperature should be in range from 20 to 45°C. Check following as soon as possible: - Correct burner grate position. Grate cannot be turned in opposite direction and must fit properly inside the burner head. - Clean burner grate below and above and remove all ashes. The whole burning process must be performed only on the grate. Pellets and ashes cannot touch burner head, only the grate. - Clean flue gas connection and chimney to make sure hot air is going into the chimney without any problem. Heat exchanger, chimney flue path must be clean otherwise air cannot escape out of the boiler and burner is overheated because of it. PVC hose, burner or electrical parts can be damaged by overheating, so you need to check and solve this issue immediately. - Correct fan speed during PID work. Low fan speed can influence burner temperature, fan is not cooling down the burner properly. Ask your installer for solution.","3331":"Bad flame detection. Fotosensor detects light intensity in values lower than 200lx. It is possible that boiler stops and displayed alarm message because of that. Following situations can occur: - Failed ignition: fotosensor didn’t see the light during automatic ignition and as a result ignition was not successful. Check following to solve this issue: - Check cleanliness of fotosensors plexi-glass. If there is dust, lower light detection is possible. Remove burner pipe and clean fotosensor by hand through the hole below removed burner pipe. - Check burner connectors. Green small connector is responsible for signal from the fotosensor. Bad connection can influence fotosensor sensitivity. - Fotosensor must be fitted inside the burner body max 1cm. When fotosensor is deeper inside the burner it can lower the flame detection. - If you see above alarm message contact your installer for help.","3332":"High chimney temperature. Temperature inside the chimney is higher than 160°C. Normal chimney temperature is below 140°C. Check following: - Flue path must be cleaned as well as heat exchange. If there is a lot of ash, hot air is escaping out of the boiler too fast. - Chimney draft. If the draft is higher than 20Pa, it creates high chimney temperature and also higher pellet consumption. Ask your installer for more information. - Ash tray position. Ash tray must be placed correctly. Ash container separates front and rear part of the boiler so hot air goes through the boiler heat exchanger corretly. If there is small distance between first smoke cooler and ash tray, air can go faster to the chimney which increases chimney temperature. Clean all ash around ashtray and try to fit the ashtray on the correct position again.","3333":"Low chimney temperature. Chimney temperature is lower than 60°C. This creates a risk of rust inside the boiler and flue path. It is necessary to increase chimney temperature: - Open flap located on the top of turbulators inside the heat exchanger. Open cleaning doors and check flap with two bolts on it. Screw both bolts in to move flap. Chimney temperature will be increased. - If there is still low temperature during maximal power of the boiler you can increase fan speed (but too much air creates bad pellet combustion). If nothing helps, ask installer for his support. - Chimney temperature during maximal power should be over 70°C.","3334":"Low return temperature. Return temperature is lower than 38°C for long period of time during boiler operation. Ask your installer for solution. Low return temperature can create rust inside the boiler. Low return water protection must be higher than 38°C. This is usually managed by valve which keeps the temperature above 38°C.","3335":"Long ignition phase. Ignition takes longer than 10min. Standard ignition period is 5min. Longer ignition phase can be influenced by following: - High chimney draft. Higher chimney draft than 25Pa can lengthen ignition time. - High air flow during ignition. Installer should check fan speed during ignition inside Service menu. - High amount of pellets for ignition. Installer can reduce the number of pellets inside Service menu. - Burner grate is not cleaned properly. - Igniter life is at the end. Igniter doesn’t produce enough heat to ignite the pellets fast. - Ask your installer for solution.","3336":"Too many ignition cycles. Our boiler is igniting too often (more than 13 times per 24hours). We recommend to ask your installer for advice. Boiler should ignite less than 10 times per one day so ignitor life is not shortened to fast. Ask your installer for solution how to decrease ignition numbers.","3337":"Fan rotation is decreased. Fan of the burner is moving slower than it should which results in high Mosfet temperature. Check and clean fan so no ash is inside. Remove the burner out of the boiler to clean fan correctly.
