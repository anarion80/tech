# :warning: Disclaimer

Due to a stall on the original [mariusz-ostoja-swierczynski/tech-controllers](https://github.com/mariusz-ostoja-swierczynski/tech-controllers) repo, we have forked.
Most of the work was done by Mariusz Ostoja-≈öwierczy≈Ñski, for which we're very thankful as the community.
It's time to move on, however. New formats of plugins appear, HA goes on with the feature implementation,
and as a community we need make sure that this plugin keeps up to the changing world. This repository also draws on work by [MichalKrasowski](https://github.com/MichalKrasowski), [micles123](https://github.com/micles123) and [nedyarrd](https://github.com/nedyarrd) - just putting it all together.

## :jigsaw: TECH Controllers integration for Home Assistant

This is an integration of heating controllers from Polish company TECH Sterowniki Sp. z o.o. It uses API to their web control application eModul.eu, therefore your controller needs to be accessible from the Internet and you need an account either on <https://emodul.eu> or <https://emodul.pl>.

The integration is based on API provided by TECH which supports the following controllers:

- L-4 Wifi
- L-7
- L-8
- WiFi 8S
- ST-8S WiFi

The integration was developed and tested against eModul demo account (username: `test`/password: `test`) which features 4 controllers:

- I-3
- L-8
- Pellet
- Solar

Additionally, I own M-9r so that is also tested.
Everything else might or might not work - needs community help, testing and reporting back what works.

The integration is in no way supported or endorsed by TECH Sterowniki sp. z o.o.

## :sparkles: Features

- Support for cold tolerance setting
- Support for zones schedules
- Services for pumps, operating mode changes, etc

## üèó Installation

1. Copy entire repository content into your `config/custom_components/tech` folder of your Home Assistant installation.
   **Note:** If you don't have `custom_components` folder you need to create it first and create `tech` folder in it.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to Configuration -> Integrations and click Add button.
4. Search for "Tech Controllers" integration and select it.
5. Enter your username (could be email) and password for your eModule account and click "Submit" button.
6. In the next step select the controllers you want to import/integrate
7. You should see "Success!" dialog with the name of the imported controller(s).
8. Now you should have Climate entities representing your home zones available in Home Assistant. Go to your UI Lovelace configuration and add Thermostat card with your Climate entities.
